# Privacy Policy - Azure Cloud Shell Security Audit Tool

**Effective Date:** December 2024  
**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how the Azure Cloud Shell Security Audit Tool ("the Tool") handles data and privacy considerations. As an open-source security assessment tool, we are committed to protecting user privacy and maintaining transparency about data handling practices.

## Information We Collect

### Audit Data
The Tool processes the following types of information during security assessments:

**Azure Resource Metadata:**
- Resource configurations and settings
- Identity and access management configurations
- Network security configurations
- Compliance status information
- Diagnostic and monitoring settings

**Audit Logs:**
- Audit execution timestamps
- User identities (Azure account information)
- Resource access patterns
- Error and diagnostic information
- Performance metrics

### Data We Do NOT Collect
The Tool is designed to avoid collecting:
- Personal identifying information beyond Azure account metadata
- Sensitive business data or application content
- Credentials, passwords, or authentication tokens
- Data stored within Azure resources (databases, storage accounts, etc.)
- Information from outside the scope of security configuration assessment

## How We Handle Data

### Local Processing
- All audit processing occurs within your Azure Cloud Shell or local environment
- No data is transmitted to external servers by default
- Audit results are stored locally unless explicitly configured otherwise
- You maintain full control over all audit data and results

### Data Minimization
The Tool follows data minimization principles:
- Only collects data necessary for security assessment
- Processes the minimum amount of information required
- Sanitizes output to remove potentially sensitive information
- Provides options to exclude specific data types from collection

### Data Retention
- Audit results are retained according to user configuration
- Default retention periods can be customized
- Users are responsible for managing data lifecycle
- No automatic deletion or backup to external systems

## Data Security

### Protection Measures
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure handling of Azure authentication
- Protection against injection attacks
- Audit trail capabilities for compliance
- Output sanitization to prevent data leakage

### Access Controls
- Tool operates with user's existing Azure permissions
- Read-only access to Azure resources by design
- No modification of Azure configurations
- Respects Azure role-based access controls

## Third-Party Data Sharing

### No External Transmission
By default, the Tool:
- Does not send data to external services
- Does not communicate with third-party APIs
- Does not upload results to cloud services
- Operates entirely within your environment

### Optional Integrations
If you configure optional features:
- Email notifications (requires SMTP configuration)
- Webhook integrations (user-controlled endpoints)
- SIEM integration (user-managed connections)
- Azure Policy assignments (within your Azure tenant)

You are responsible for:
- Configuring these integrations securely
- Understanding their privacy implications
- Complying with applicable data protection laws
- Managing any resulting data sharing

## User Rights and Controls

### Data Access
You have the right to:
- Access all audit data generated by the Tool
- Export audit results in multiple formats
- Configure what data is collected and processed
- Review audit logs and execution history

### Data Control
You can:
- Configure output sanitization levels
- Exclude specific resource types from audits
- Control data retention periods
- Delete audit results at any time

### Configuration Options
The Tool provides controls for:
- Enabling/disabling specific data collection
- Customizing output formats and content
- Setting data retention policies
- Configuring audit trails and logging levels

## Compliance Considerations

### Regulatory Frameworks
When using the Tool for compliance assessments:
- Users are responsible for meeting applicable privacy laws
- Audit data may be subject to retention requirements
- Cross-border data considerations may apply
- Industry-specific regulations may impose additional requirements

### Common Privacy Laws
Consider these requirements when using the Tool:

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**
- Assess whether audit data contains personal data
- Ensure legal basis for processing
- Implement appropriate security measures
- Provide data subject rights as required

**CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):**
- Determine if audit data includes personal information
- Implement appropriate security safeguards
- Provide consumer rights as applicable

**HIPAA (Healthcare):**
- Avoid processing protected health information
- Implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
- Ensure business associate agreements where applicable

## International Data Transfers

### Cross-Border Considerations
- Audit data remains within your Azure region by default
- Multi-region Azure environments may involve data crossing borders
- Users are responsible for compliance with applicable transfer restrictions
- Consider using Azure regions that meet your data residency requirements

### Data Sovereignty
- The Tool respects Azure's data residency features
- Users control where audit results are stored
- No automatic replication to other regions
- Compliance with local data sovereignty laws is user responsibility

## Children's Privacy

The Tool is not intended for use by individuals under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18.

## Data Breach Response

### Incident Response
In the event of a security incident:
- Users are responsible for detecting and responding to breaches
- Implement appropriate incident response procedures
- Consider notification requirements under applicable laws
- Review and update security measures as needed

### Tool Vulnerabilities
If security vulnerabilities are discovered in the Tool:
- Report through responsible disclosure channels
- Monitor project updates for security patches
- Apply updates promptly when available
- Review audit results for potential impact

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

### Policy Updates
This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect:
- Changes in Tool functionality
- Updates to privacy laws and regulations
- User feedback and best practices
- Security and privacy improvements

### Notification of Changes
- Major changes will be documented in release notes
- Users should review the policy periodically
- Continued use indicates acceptance of updates
- Significant changes may require explicit consent

## Contact and Questions

### Privacy Questions
